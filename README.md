# Python-Week-8

Based on the analysis, i have identified several key observations:

Key Insights
1. Brazil has the highest number of reported cases across all dates, with case trends showing waves of infections.
2.  USA showed rapid spikes in cases during peak pandemic waves but had a significant increase in vaccination rates after mid-2021. 
3.  Kenya had comparatively fewer cases but saw steady increases in vaccination coverage from 2021 onward. 
4. The death rate varies widely across countries, showing potential differences in healthcare responses and population vulnerabilities. 
5.  Vaccination rollouts impacted infection trends, leading to decreased case numbers in highly vaccinated regions.
6.  Afghanistan was least affected the the covid- 19 virus.

Reporting Format
The analysis includes code snippets, charts, and key statistics within a Jupyter Notebook.
Markdown cells explain findings, making the notebook suitable for presentation.
The notebook can be opened in VSCode
The Jupyter notebook provides a few visual representations using:
  - pie charts
  - bar graphs
  - line graphs
  - scatterplots
  - chloropeth

Final Thoughts
This project successfully examines COVID-19 trends using data science techniques. By leveraging Python tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we clean, analyze, and visualize global COVID-19 data.
